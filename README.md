# Yerevan Car Parking Patterns Analysis

>  **Warning**: Data folder is not provided.

Welcome to the Yerevan Parking Pattern Analysis project! <br>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">
This research investigates the parking patterns in various regions of Yerevan, the capital city of Armenia, leveraging data
collected from the GPS sensors of the population's smartphones. The methodology involves the collection and analysis of
anonymized GPS data obtained from smartphone applications used by residents and visitors. The research focuses on identifying
and characterizing parking patterns, considering factors such as peak parking hours, average durations, and preferred locations.

### Objectives and Significance

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">
The primary objective is to unravel the mysteries surrounding parking behaviors, providing indispensable insights crucial for
effective city planning and the optimization of parking infrastructure.This research aims to understand parking behavior within
defined parking areas using only raw GPS data collected over time. Our objective is to discover parking behavior cues and irregularities
that policymakers and urban planners might use to adjust and optimize the management of parking strategies. We are interested in determining
the time of the day that parking is most used, how long parking events are on average, and how outside factors, such as the day of the week,
the time of day, or even special occasions, affect parking behavior. Therefore, the main goal of this research is not to locate parking spots
but to understand why, when, and how people are parking in specified areas.

The analysis is performed based on the raw GPS mobile data collected from 2019 to 2022, covering the area of Yerevan, Armenia. We are interested
in the red line parking lots in the Center and Arabkir regions of Yerevan. It is remarkable to note that data distribution may differ yearly due
to changes in user behavior, device exposure, and data-gathering methods. Consequently, this provides both opportunities and challenges when
processing  the data to understand dynamics over time. However, our data is substantial enough to draw some conclusions about the dynamics around
the red lines. However, before drawing conclusions, the raw GPS data has to undergo preprocessing stages and must be processed largely by applying
mathematical modeling to become suitable for analysis.
